# What I've learned:
- what is sequelize;
- how to connect to the database;
- instead of writing sql queries manually, you can use packages like sequelize to focus on the node.js code and work with native JS objects;
- sequelize allows you define models and interact with the database through them;
- set up relations and interact with related models through them;
