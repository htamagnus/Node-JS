# What I've learned:
- whats is the mvc;
- adding controllers;
- adding a model;
---

## Model:
- responsible for representing your data;
- responsible for managing your data (saving, fetching);
- contains data-related logic;
---
## View: 
- what the user sees;
- shouldn't contain too much logic;
---
## Controller:
- connects model and view;
- should only make sure that the two can communicate (in both directions);
